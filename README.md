# 🏨 **AtliQ Grands Hotel Booking Analysis** 📊

## 📌 **Problem**

AtliQ Grands, a prestigious chain of five-star hotels across India, has been serving customers for over 20 years. However, due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective management decisions, they have seen a decline in market share and revenue, particularly in the luxury/business hotel segment.

To reverse this trend, the Managing Director of AtliQ Grands decided to incorporate **Business and Data Intelligence**. However, AtliQ Grands lacks an in-house data analytics team, so they hired a third-party service provider  to extract actionable insights from their historical booking data. The objective is to use these insights to enhance decision-making, optimize revenue, and regain their competitive position.

## 💡 **Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing **AtliQ Grands’ historical booking data** to uncover insights that can help improve their market share and revenue. The dataset contains detailed information on hotel properties, room types, bookings, and revenue.

### **Key Objectives:**
- 📅 Analyze booking trends (e.g., peak periods, popular room categories).
- 💵 Understand revenue patterns and the impact of cancellations/no-shows.
- 🏨 Evaluate individual hotel performance and room category success.
- 📈 Provide recommendations based on data-driven insights to improve business operations.

## 🔨 **Task**

### 1. **Create Metrics** 📏
Based on the provided **metric list**, create the necessary metrics that will help in tracking hotel performance, bookings, and revenue. This may include key performance indicators (KPIs) like:

- **Revenue per Hotel** 💰: Total revenue generated by each hotel.
- **Revenue per Room Category** 🛏: Total revenue generated by each room category (RT1, RT2, etc.).
- **Booking Success Rate** ✅: Percentage of successful bookings compared to total attempts.
  - Formula: `(Successful Bookings / Total Bookings) * 100`
- **Occupancy Rate** 📊: Percentage of rooms occupied in relation to total room capacity.
  - Formula: `(Successful Bookings / Total Capacity) * 100`
- **Average Length of Stay (LOS)** 🏨: The average number of nights customers stay at the hotel.
  - Formula: `(Total Nights Stayed / Total Bookings)`
- **Cancellation Rate** ❌: Percentage of cancelled bookings.
  - Formula: `(Cancelled Bookings / Total Bookings) * 100`
- **Revenue Realization** 💵: Percentage of revenue realized after cancellations/no-shows.
  - Formula: `(Revenue Realized / Revenue Generated) * 100`
- **Customer Satisfaction** ⭐: Average customer rating for the hotel.

### 2. **Create the Dashboard** 📊
Develop a **dashboard** according to the **mock-up** provided by stakeholders. The dashboard should include:
- A visual representation of key metrics (Revenue, Booking Success Rate, Occupancy Rate, etc.).
- Filters for room categories, booking dates, and hotel properties.
- Visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs for easy tracking of booking trends and revenue.

### 3. **Generate Relevant Insights** 🔍
In addition to the given metrics, look for hidden trends or patterns in the data that may not be part of the provided metric list or mock-up. For example:
- Identify underperforming hotels or room categories.
- Discover times or days of the week with unusually high or low bookings.
- Analyze the effect of booking status (e.g., No-shows, Cancellations) on revenue realization.

## 🛠 **Tools Used**

The following tools were utilized to perform data analysis and build the dashboard:

- **Excel** 🧮: For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- **Power BI** 📊: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **SQL** 💻: For querying and extracting relevant data from databases.

## 📁 **Dataset Files**

The dataset consists of the following CSV files, which contain all the data needed for analysis:

1. **`dim_date.csv`** 🗓: Contains metadata for dates (e.g., day types, week numbers).
2. **`dim_hotels.csv`** 🏨: Information about each hotel, including hotel name, category (luxury/business), and city.
3. **`dim_rooms.csv`** 🛏: Information on room types and their respective classes (e.g., Standard, Premium).
4. **`fact_aggregated_bookings.csv`** 📈: Aggregated booking data, including successful bookings and room capacity.
5. **`fact_bookings.csv`** 📅: Detailed booking records, including booking dates, revenue, ratings, and booking statuses.

## 📝 **Steps to Reproduce**

1. **Data Cleaning** 🧹: Clean and preprocess the data in Excel or Google Sheets. Handle missing values, format dates, and aggregate data as needed.
2. **Data Analysis** 🔍: Use pivot tables, formulas, and filters in Excel/Google Sheets to derive key insights from the data.
3. **Visualization** 📊: Create visualizations and build an interactive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI to represent key metrics and insights.
4. **Reporting** 📄: Compile the analysis into a report, providing clear recommendations based on the data.

## 🚀 **Outcome**

- Actionable insights into booking trends, hotel performance, and revenue generation.
- An interactive dashboard to track KPIs and make data-driven decisions.
- Strategic recommendations for improving market share and revenue in the competitive hotel industry.
